# SQL-Project-university-users
I used MySQL to extract information from a database structure instead of a dataset. 


Using the database structure below, please write the SQL that would be needed to answer the following questions:


1. Show the top 10 universities in terms of the number of users we have on our platform. Include university name, number of users




2. Show the top 50 books in terms of time spent being read in the last 7 days. Include the book title, total time spent reading




3. Show the most popular publishers for the subject “Medicine”, based on (a) the count of books read, and (b) the total duration read. Include publisher name, count of books, count of users, and total duration.





4. Following question 3, for the most popular publisher (by the count of books read), break this down further by topic name and show a count of books read in each topic.
